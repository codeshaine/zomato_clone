# zomato_clone

##Description:

<p>This is a clone of the one of the popular website called zomato. The main intention of making this project is to understand the working of vanilla css and javascript.Yeah there is no Framework,nor library and nor components are used. Everything is built form scratch.Because of that this project took very time and made me just stop working on this. But it seems i have completed more or likely to a point where this website is responsive.</p>

##Note:

<p>Since this website is a clone made using vanilla css and js, so i have not made some features and links those work in real website also does not work here. The main intention was learning. so use this code for learning ..</p>
